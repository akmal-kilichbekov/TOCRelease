I would like to share one interesting and useful report which creates Transport of copies and releases them to the target system.

In some projects we came across with difficulty to test our developments due to not having enough test data. 
Recently I had one project where no test data is available in DEV system and we need create TOC and move it to quality system to test every single change in the logic.
At the same time that makes you to write code more carefully, since you don't want create TOC over and over again :)

But this process takes time such as creating TOC and import it to target system, besides I found it sometime annoying. 
So I decided to create report which does the same job instead of me.

All I need to provide is transport request number, it is also easy to select thanks to value help in selection screen.Â
